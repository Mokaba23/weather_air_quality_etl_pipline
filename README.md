#This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that integrates weather and air quality data for a specified city over a defined time period. The data is extracted from external APIs, transformed (cleaned and processed), and loaded into a PostgreSQL database. The goal of this project is to provide a clean, well-structured dataset for further analysis or reporting.
